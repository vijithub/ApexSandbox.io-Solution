    consider the following plants to be companions: 
    lettuce and cucumbers, lettuce and onions, 
    onions and carrots, and onions and tomatoes.

    Try structuring the correct pairs using the following logic: 
    if the first plant is onions, the second should be lettuce, carrots, or tomatoes. 
    If the first plant is lettuce, then the second should be cucumbers or onions. 
    If the first plant is cucumbers, the second should be lettuce. 
    If the first plant is carrots, the second should be onions. 
    If the first plant is tomatoes, the second should be onions. 
    If none of the above match, the plants are not companions.
